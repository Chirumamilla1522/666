TKO Group Holdings, Inc. (TKO) is an American media conglomerate created by Endeavor as part of a merger between World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE) and Zuffa, LLC, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Since the completion of the merger on September 12, 2023, both WWE and UFC operate as divisions under the banner of TKO.
The merger marked the first time that WWE has not been solely and primarily majority-controlled by the McMahon family, which founded the company and owned it for over 70 years. This marked the third time that the UFC has changed ownership as its parent company Zuffa had been sold to Endeavor in 2016. Zuffa had previously purchased the UFC from the Semaphore Entertainment Group in 2001.
Endeavor chief executive officer (CEO) Ari Emanuel is the CEO of TKO and Mark Shapiro serves as president and chief operating officer. Nick Khan became the president of WWE post-merger and Dana White has since served as CEO of the UFC. 
As of 2024, the UFC and WWE were the two most valuable combat sports organizations in the world according to Forbes. UFC was listed as the most valued mixed martial arts (MMA) company with a revenue of $1.406 billion and WWE being the most valued professional wrestling promotion with a revenue of $1.398 billion in 2023.
On February 28, 2025, TKO acquired IMG, On Location Events, and Professional Bull Riders from its parent company Endeavor. On April 19, WWE, a subsidiary of TKO, announced that it had acquired the Mexican lucha libre promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide.
