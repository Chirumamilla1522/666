Otis Worldwide Corporation (branded as the Otis Elevator Company, its former legal name) styled as OTIS   is an American company that develops, manufactures and markets 
elevators, escalators, moving walkways, and related equipment.
Based in Farmington, Connecticut, U.S., Otis is the world's largest manufacturer of vertical transportation systems, principally focusing on elevators, escalators, and moving walkways. The company pioneered the development of the "safety elevator", invented by Elisha Otis in 1852, which used a special mechanism that locked the elevator car in place against hoisting rope failure.
The Otis Elevator Company was acquired by United Technologies in 1976, but it was spun off as an independent company 44 years later in April 2020 as Otis Worldwide Corporation.
Its slogan is "Made to move you".
