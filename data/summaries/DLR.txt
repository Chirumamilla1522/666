Digital Realty is a leading purchaser of renewable energy in the industry and is making considerable efforts to make the switch to renewable power across its entire portfolio. 126 data centers globally are matched with renewable energy, with 100% renewable energy powering its European portfolio and U.S. colocation data centers. Digital Realty has 1 GW of wind and solar projects under contract in U.S. states including Texas, Illinois, North Carolina, Oregon, Arizona and Virginia. Its renewable portfolio resulted in 1.8 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions (MtCO2e) avoided in 2022, which is comparable to the annual electricity needs of 361,800 U.S. homes. The company has also installed 1.8 MW of solar panels at properties in Kenya, Greece, Switzerland, and South Korea.
