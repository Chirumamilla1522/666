NVR, Inc. is an American company engaged in home construction headquartered in Reston, Virginia. It also operates a mortgage banking and title services business. The company primarily operates on the East Coast of the United States, but its operations encompass 14 states as well as Washington, D.C. In 2021, 22% of the company's revenue was from the Washington metropolitan area.
NVR operates under the Ryan Homes, NVHomes, and Heartland Homes brands. The company typically does not engage in land development; it acquires finished land lots that are ready for building, which the company believes mitigates risk. As of 2023, the company is the 4th largest home construction company in the United States based on the number of homes closed. It is ranked 389th on the 2022 Fortune 500.
The company's stock price is the second most expensive on U.S. exchanges, behind only Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares.
