T-Mobile US, Inc. is an American wireless network operator headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. Its majority shareholder and namesake is the German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom. T-Mobile is the second largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 131 million subscribers as of March 31, 2025.
The company was founded in 1994 by John W. Stanton of the Western Wireless Corporation as VoiceStream Wireless. Deutsche Telekom then gained plurality ownership in 2001 and renamed it after its global T-Mobile brand. As of April 2023, the German company holds a 51.4% stake in the company.
T-Mobile US operates two main brands: T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile (acquired in a 2013 reverse takeover of MetroPCS that also led to T-Mobile's listing on the NASDAQ). In 2020, T-Mobile expanded through the acquisition of Sprint, which also made T-Mobile the operator of Assurance Wireless, a service subsidized by the federal Lifeline program. The company's growth continued in 2024 with the acquisitions of Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile, two low-cost mobile virtual network operators which remain separate brands. As of 2025, the company plans to acquire the wireless operations of UScellular.
