Carrier Global Corporation is an American multinational heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, and fire and security equipment corporation based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Carrier was founded in 1915 as an independent company manufacturing and distributing HVAC systems, and has since expanded to include manufacturing commercial refrigeration and food service equipment, and fire and security technologies.
As of 2022, it was a $20.4 billion company with over 52,000 employees serving customers in 160 countries on six continents.
Carrier was acquired by United Technologies in 1979, but it was spun off as an independent company 41 years later in 2020, as was the Otis Elevator Company.
