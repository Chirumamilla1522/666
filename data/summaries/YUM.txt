Yum! Brands, Inc. (sometimes called simply Yum!) is an American multinational fast food corporation. It is a spin-off of PepsiCo, after they acquired KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. PepsiCo divested the brands in 1997, and these consolidated as Yum! The company operates KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill since 2020, except in China, where the brands are operated by another company known as Yum China. Yum! previously also owned Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants. Yum! was founded as Tricon Global Restaurants after PepsiCo finalized the split. In 2002, they took their current name after they merged with Yorkshire Global Restaurants, which at the time was the parent company of A&W, who also spun off an international branch.
Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Yum! is one of the world's largest fast food restaurant companies in terms of system units.  In 2016, Yum! had 43,617 restaurants, including 2,859 that were company-owned and 40,758 that were franchised, in 135 nations and territories worldwide. Due to it being a spin-off of PepsiCo, all restaurants owned by this company do not serve Coca-Cola as a soft drink, and instead serve Pepsi.  New Zealand restaurants serve Coca-Cola.
