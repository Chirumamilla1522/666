FedEx Corporation, originally known as Federal Express Corporation, is an American multinational conglomerate holding company specializing in transportation, e-commerce, and business services.

Over the years, the company has expanded its operations to include FedEx Ground, FedEx Office, FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Freight, and several other services through a network of subsidiaries.
