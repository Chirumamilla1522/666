Intuit Inc. is an American multinational business software company that specializes in financial software. The company is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and the CEO is Sasan Goodarzi.  Intuit's products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring  and personal accounting service Credit Karma, and email marketing platform Mailchimp. As of 2019, more than 95% of its revenues and earnings come from its activities within the United States. Listed on Nasdaq, the company is a component of the Nasdaq-100, S&P 100, and S&P 500 stock market indices.
Intuit offered a free online service called TurboTax Free File as well as a similarly named service called TurboTax Free Edition which is not free for most users. In 2019, investigations by ProPublica found that Intuit deliberately steered taxpayers from the free TurboTax Free File to the paid TurboTax Free Edition using tactics including search engine delisting and a deceptive discount targeted to members of the military. As of the 2021 tax filing season, TurboTax no longer participates in the Free File Alliance.
Intuit has lobbied extensively against the IRS providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms, which is the norm in developed countries.
