Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) is an American multinational tobacco company, with products sold in over 180 countries. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro; its other major cigarette brands include L&M and Chesterfield.  Philip Morris International is often referred to as one of the companies comprising Big Tobacco.
The company originated in 1847 in London. However the present company was founded in March 2008 when it was spun off by its then American parent Altria group, of which Philip Morris International was an operating company of. PMI's legal seat is presently in Stamford, Connecticut, but it does not operate in the United States of America: Philip Morris USA, a subsidiary of PMI's former parent Altria, owns the Philip Morris brands there. PMI's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. It employs more than 1,500 people.
With tobacco being addictive and a leading cause of preventable death globally, the company has faced litigation and regulatory measures from governments and has been the subject of scrutiny by the World Health Organization. The company knowingly maintained the claim that smoking cigarettes is harmless, despite overwhelming external and internal evidence that smoking is addictive and dangerous. In response, the company has diversified in the 21st century into smoke-free products such as the Iqos brand of heated tobacco products, Zyn brand of nicotine pouches, and Veev brand of electronic cigarettes.
The company ranked No. 128 in the 2023 Fortune 500 list of the largest corporations by total revenue. In 2022, the company's revenue in Russia amounted to RUB400 billion (roubles). National Agency on Corruption Prevention of Ukraine included PMI in its  International Sponsors of War list in 2023.
