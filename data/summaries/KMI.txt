Kinder Morgan, Inc. is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America.  The company specializes in owning and controlling oil and gas pipelines and terminals.
Kinder Morgan owns an interest in or operates approximately 83,000 miles (134,000 km) of pipelines and 143 terminals. The company's pipelines transport natural gas, liquefied natural gas, ethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen, refined petroleum products, crude oil, carbon dioxide, and more. Kinder Morgan also stores or handles a variety of products and materials at their terminals such as gasoline, jet fuel, ethanol, coal, petroleum coke, and steel.
The company has approximately 72,000 miles (116,000 km) of natural gas pipelines and is the largest natural gas pipeline operator in the United States, moving about 40 percent of the natural gas consumed in the country. The company previously had built a major presence in Canada with the Trans Mountain pipeline, but that infrastructure is now publicly owned and operated. The company's CO2 division traditionally provides carbon dioxide (CO2) for enhanced oil recovery projects in North America, but also increasingly for carbon sequestration efforts.
