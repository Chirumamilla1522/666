The Phillips 66 Company is an American multinational energy company headquartered in Westchase, Houston, Texas. Its name, dating back to 1927 as a trademark of the Phillips Petroleum Company, assisted in establishing the newly reconfigured Phillips 66. The company today was formed ten years after Phillips merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company spun off its refining, chemical, and retail assets – known in the oil industry as downstream operations – into a new company bearing the Phillips 66 name. It began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. 
The company is engaged in refining, transporting, and marketing natural gas liquids (NGL) petrochemicals. They are also active in the research and development of emerging energy sources and partners with Chevron on chemicals through a joint venture known as Chevron Phillips Chemical. 
Phillips 66 is ranked No. 29 on the Fortune 500 list and No. 74 on the Fortune Global 500 list as of 2022, with revenues of over $115 billion USD. Phillips 66 has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and owns and licenses service station brands across the country, such as 76 and Conoco within the United States, and JET in Europe.
