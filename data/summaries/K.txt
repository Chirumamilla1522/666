Kellanova, formerly known as the Kellogg Company and commonly known as Kellogg's, is an American multinational food manufacturing company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, US. Kellanova produces and markets convenience foods and snack foods, including crackers and toaster pastries, cereal, and markets their products by several well-known brands including the Kellogg's brand itself, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It.  Outside North America, Kellanova markets cereals such as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Coco Pops.
Kellogg's products are manufactured and marketed in over 180 countries. Kellanova's largest factory is at Trafford Park in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, which is also the location of its UK headquarters. Other corporate office locations outside of Chicago include Battle Creek, Dublin (European Headquarters), Shanghai, and Quer√©taro City, Mexico. Kellogg's held a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II until her death in 2022.
Kellogg's was split into two companies on October 2, 2023, with WK Kellogg Co owning the North American cereal division, and the existing company being rebranded to "Kellanova", owning snack brands such as Pop-Tarts and Pringles alongside the international cereal division. The purpose of the split was to separate the faster-growing convenience food, and international cereal products market, from the slower growth North American cereal market. "Kellogg's" itself became a brand name of both companies.
Mars Inc., the owner of M&M's and Snickers, agreed to acquire Kellanova for nearly $30 billion in August 2024, with the purchase expected to be completed in early 2025.
